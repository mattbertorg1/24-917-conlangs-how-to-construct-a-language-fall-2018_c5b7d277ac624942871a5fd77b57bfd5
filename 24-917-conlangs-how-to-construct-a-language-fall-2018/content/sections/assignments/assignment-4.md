Syntax
------

Now it’s time to start thinking about the syntax of your language.

### Problem One

What’s the most common order of subject, verb, and object? How free is the word order? Show me at least two sentences with subjects, verbs, and objects.

### Problem Two

Pick two parts of the noun phrase (other than the noun) and tell me their order with respect to each other and the noun. Give me an example.

### Problem Three

Does your language have prepositions or postpositions? Show me an example, as part of a complete sentence.

### Problem Four

Give me an example containing an embedded clause.
